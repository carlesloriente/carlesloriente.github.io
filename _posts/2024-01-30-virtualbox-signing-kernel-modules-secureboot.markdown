## Simplifying Secure Boot: Automating Kernel Module Signing with VirtualBox Support

Secure Boot is a security feature in modern systems, but it can pose challenges when dealing with kernel modules. For those (like me) who have struggled with signing kernel modules for use with VirtualBox, I have good news: An automated script that simplifies the entire process and ensures smooth integration.

### Introducing: [sign-kernel-modules-secureboot script](https://github.com/carlesloriente/sign-kernel-modules-secureboot){:target="_blank"}

#### Purpose

The primary goal of this script is to provide a hassle-free method for signing kernel modules compatible with Secure Boot, tailored explicitly for seamless integration with VirtualBox.

#### Key Features
